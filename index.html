      <h2>Hi Kavya 💕</h2>
      <p class="tagline">This little corner of the internet belongs only to you, <span class="highlight-name">my Kavu</span>.</p>
      <p>
        This website is a gift from your Babyboy, <span class="highlight-name">Pushkar Khatri</span.>
        Every color, every line of code, and every word here is just another way of saying one thing:
        you mean the world to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        When people ask me what love feels like, I wish I could just show them this page—
        because it has our memories, our chaos, our peace, our distance, and still our forever.
        You turned my ordinary days into something I actually look forward to.
      </p>

      <h3>Why You Are My Person ✨</h3>
      <ul class="reasons-list">
        <li>Your smile can fix even the worst kind of day I have.</li>
        <li>You know my flaws and still choose me, again and again.</li>
        <li>Talking to you feels like finally reaching home after a long day.</li>
        <li>You push me to be better, even when I feel like giving up.</li>
        <li>You are not just my girlfriend, you’re my favorite habit.</li>
      </ul>

  <!-- OUR STORY -->
  <section id="story">
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Our Story 🎬</h2>
      <p>
        Our story honestly feels like a movie, but the best part is that it’s real, and it’s ours.
        We were in the same school—me in science, you in commerce—yet somehow we existed more as
        Instagram IDs than real people for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We followed each other, saw each other’s stories, knew each other’s names,
        but didn’t really talk. The universe had its own slow-burn script for us.
        We didn’t know it back then, but we were already part of each other’s background.
      </p>

      <h3>It All Started With a Roll Number 📚</h3>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span>That one test day</span>
          <p>
            The first time we actually spoke in real life was when you asked me for my roll number
            for a periodic test. Of all the ways a love story could start, ours began with
            “Roll number bata do na” energy.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span>Annual exams & first texts</span>
          <p>
            During the annual exams, you finally texted me. One message turned into a conversation,
            the conversation turned into late-night talks, and somewhere in between,
            you quietly dropped the truth—you liked me. That moment still lives rent-free in my heart.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <span>From friends to lovers</span>
          <p>
            Our start was messy and imperfect, but real. We went from random school acquaintances,
            to friends, to people who couldn’t imagine a day without each other.
            Fights happened, drama happened, breakups happened—but somehow, we always found our way back.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        We created our own little universe with scooty rides, inside jokes, and endless chats.
        It wasn’t a filmy “perfect couple” story; it was better than that—it was honest,
        stubborn, emotional, and ours.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Favorite Dates & Places 🍟</h3>
      <p>
        Thinking about our dates automatically puts a smile on my face.
        Our first proper one was that crazy scooty ride on Koni Road,
        with wind, traffic, and your laughter mixing into the best kind of chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        We collected places like memories:
        Cafe Yuva, McDonald’s, and especially <span class="highlight-name">Urban Bistro</span>—
        the place that means way more to us than any fancy location ever could.
        You already know exactly why that place is so special.
      </p>

      <div class="quote-box">
        “If someone asked me what my favorite story is, I’d say: the one where
        a roll number request turned into a lifetime of love.”
      </div>

      <h3>Distance, Drops and Determination 💔➡️💪</h3>
      <p>
        Things got tough when your dad found out and we had to break up for a while.
        Those days were heavy. Then after 12th, life pulled us into different cities—
        you went to DU for UG, and I took a drop for IIT JEE.
        Even apart, our hearts never really left each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        We started talking again, building dreams carefully:
        me working hard to get into IIT Delhi so I could be with you.
        On my JEE Advance day, I had a 103 fever and barely any sleep,
        but I still gave the exam and cracked it—just not the IIT we had imagined.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hated the idea of long-distance, but here we are—doing something
        I once thought I could never handle. Right now I’m in Raipur at my NIT Raipur hostel,
        and you’re in Gautam Nagar at Yash PG. We are in different cities,
        but somehow, you are still the closest person to me.
      </p>

      <div class="quote-box">
        “No matter the distance, your name still feels like home.”
      </div>

      <p>
        I miss you more than words can carry, but I love you even more than that.
        This website is just one small way of sending a piece of my heart to you,
        wherever you open it from.

      <h2>Our Memories 📸</h2>
      <p>
        These are not just photos for me—they’re paused moments of the life
        I get to live with you. Each picture holds a version of us that I never want to forget.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some are from our best days, some from random ones,
        but every single one reminds me that life feels extra beautiful
        when you are in the frame with me.

  <!-- FUTURE -->
  <section id="future">
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Our Future Plans 🌈</h2>
      <p>
        We’ve handled school, family drama, distance, exams, heartbreak, and healing—
        so it’s only fair that the future owes us a soft, peaceful, happy life together.
        And that’s exactly what I’m working towards every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I picture my future, it’s not just a job or a city or a house.
        It’s you making fun of me while I study, us deciding what to eat,
        us planning trips, us existing together in the same space,
        without hostel timings or PG rules between us.
      </p>

      <h3>Little Dreams With You 💭</h3>
      <ul class="reasons-list">
        <li>Late-night walks where we actually walk, not worry about “last bus kab ka hai”.</li>
        <li>Study dates where I stare at you more than my books (as usual).</li>
        <li>A home where your laughter is the background sound of every room.</li>
        <li>Trips where we don’t have to lie about “group study” plans.</li>
        <li>Growing old with you and still teasing you like it’s day one.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        One day, this won’t be a “long-distance love story”. It will just be
        a love story where two people who refused to give up
        finally get the peace they always deserved—with each other.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Until that day, I’ll keep choosing you in every message, every call,
        every decision, and every tomorrow.

  <!-- LOVE LETTER -->
  <section id="letter">
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Love Letter 💌</h2>
      <p>
        Some feelings are too big to fit on a single page,
        so your love letter lives in its own little space.
        It’s filled with our memories, my promises, silly nicknames,
        and the kind of honesty that only you bring out of me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever you miss me, or we fight, or the distance feels too loud,
        you can open that letter and remember that no matter what,
        I’m the guy who made you a whole website just to say “I love you”.
