    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>💖 Our Story: It All Started with a Roll NumberThis is the part of the website I was most excited to write. Our story is kind of a movie, honestly.So, we were in the same school, me in science, you in commerce. Funny thing is, we knew each other better online than in person—just following each other on Instagram, checking out snaps, that kind of thing. We never actually talked face-to-face until late in 11th grade. The first time we spoke? You needed my roll number for a periodic test. Seriously, that’s how it started! Then, during the annual exams, you finally texted me. We just talked and talked, and eventually, you dropped the bomb: you liked me. That was our very first real interaction, and that feeling was the best.</p>
        
    <p>   Our relationship wasn't perfect right away—it was messy. We went from being friends to being lovers, and that journey was seriously great. We’ve been through a lot of fights, broken up, gotten back together, and all that drama. But we always found our way back. Now, we’re finally on the same page, and I just want this chapter to be infinite. I want to grow old and die with you, that’s the goal.</p>
        
    <p>   Thinking about our dates just makes me smile. Our first one was that crazy scooty ride on Koni Road. We also have our spots: Cafe Yuva, MacDonald's, and especially Urban Bistro—which is my absolute favorite, for reasons you know very well! I won't use up too many words here, though; I'm saving a lot of this stuff for your love letter!</p>
        
    <p>   Things got tough when your dad found out, and we had to break up for a while. Then, after 12th grade, we went long-distance—you went to DU for UG, and I took a drop for IIT JEE. Even though we were apart, we started talking again, planning everything around me getting into IIT DELHI the next year so we could be together. The universe had other plans. On my advance day, I had a 103 fever and hadn't slept, but I still cracked the exam. I just didn't get the IIT I’d hoped for.</p>
        
     <P>  I hated the idea of being long-distance, but here we are, trying our best. I'm sitting here in Raipur at nit raipur hostel, missing you like crazy, and making this website. You're chilling in Gautam Nagar at Yash PG. I miss you a lot, and I love you even more, my kuchupuchu.Your babyboy</p>
